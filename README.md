# Heart Beat

Heart Beat is a data visualization, sonification, and analysis of infant mortality rates throughout time. I created this webpage as an entry in Stanford's CS109 project competition. 


When you visit the webpage you can first get examine the current state of infant mortality rates worldwide.

Next, I allow the user to listen to a sonic representation of infant mortality rate over time where the higher the worldwide the infant mortality rate the faster the heartbeat. The results are chilling!
